                  directed edges crawled from twitter.com). Each vertex represents a Twitter user
                  account and each edge represents a following relation. It is well-known that the
                  web displays a bow-tie structure [20], where 30% of the vertices are strongly
                  connected. We conduct a bow-tie analysis on the Twitter network, and discover that
                  only 8% (38,913) of the vertices are strongly connected.

              We construct the evolving coauthor network from ArnetMiner5. We collected 1,768,776
              publications published during 1986 to 2012 with 1,629,217 authors involved. We regard
              each year as a time stamp and there are 27 time stamps in total. At each time stamp,
              we create an edge between two authors if they have coauthored at least one paper in
              the most recent 3 years (including the current year). We convert the undirected
              coauthor network into directed network by regarding each undirected edge as two
              symmetric directed edges.

              The work intends to study how to quantify link semantics. Specifically, an ideal
              output of link semantics analysis is to provide users with the following information:
              (1) multiple topics discussed in each page; (2) semantics of a link between two pages;
              and (3) the influential strength of each link. With such an analysis, a user could
              easily trace the origins of an idea/technique, analyze the evolution and impact of a
              topic, filter the pages by certain categories of links, as well as zoom in and zoom
              out the linkage tracing graph with the degree of influence.

              used as the âgolden metricâ for expert finding. They were also used to create the test
              sets for association search. The following table shows the 13 topics and statistics of
              people we have collected. In the 13 topics, OA and SW are from PC members of the

              To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed association search approach, we created
              8 test sets. Each of the person pair contains a source person (including his name and
              id) and a target person (including his name and id). The test sets were created as
              follows. We randomly selected 1,000 person pairs from the researcher network and
              create the first test set.

              We use the above people lists to create the other 8 test sets. We created four test

              three test sets, we are aimed at testing association search between persons from the

              The data set is used for research purpose only. This version includes 166,192,182
              papers from MAG and 154,771,162 papers from AMiner. We generated 64,639,608 linking
              (matching) relations between the two graphs. In the future, more linking results, like
              authors, will be published. It can be used as a unified large academic graph for
              studying citation network, paper content, and others, and can be also used to study
              integration of multiple academic graphs.

              Name ambiguity has long been viewed as a challenging problem in many applications,
              such as scientific literature management, people search, and social network analysis.
              When we search a person name in these systems, many documents (e.g., papers, webpages)
              containing that personâs name may be returned. Which documents are about the person we
              care about? Although much research has been conducted, the problem remains largely
              unsolved, especially with the rapid growth of the people information available on the
              Web.

              SciKG is a rich knowledge graph designed for scientific purpose (currently including
              computer science (CS)), consisting of concepts, experts, and papers. The concepts and
              their relationships are extracted from &nbsp;
              <a href="http://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs_flat.cfm#10002950">ACM &nbsp;</a>

              </a>
              , supplemented with the definition of each concept from, e.g., Wikipedia. We further
              use &nbsp;<a href="https://www.aminer.cn/">AMiner &nbsp;</a>to associate top ranked
              experts and most relevant papers to each concept. Each expert has position,
              affiliation, research interests and also the link connecting to AMiner (for further
              rich information if necessary) and each paper contains meta information such as title,
              authors, abstract, publication venue, and year.
